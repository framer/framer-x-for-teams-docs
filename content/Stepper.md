A **Stepper** allows a user to choose a number between a minimum and maximum value.

## Design

### Minimum Requirements

The Stepper component will be delivered as a code component and should at least have the following:

- Default state
- Click state
- Recommended size: 260px x 44px

For some inspiration, here are some slider examples:

## Code

### Starting Template

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Frame } from "framer";
//@ts-ignore
import { colors } from "@framer/tishogeorgiev.framer-x-for-teams-colors/code/canvas";

export function Stepper(props) {
  return <Frame style={{}} center />;
}

// Change the width and height here to fit your component
Stepper.defaultProps = {
  width: 260,
  height: 44
};
```

### Tips

Framer has a nice [API](https://www.framer.com/api/) to help add things like animations, state, and variants. Here are some tips that might help when creating your component:

- Steppers noramlly have some sort of state to hold the number. Try to use [React.useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) to hold your component state!
- Check the [Learn Design System](https://framer-learn-docs.netlify.com/docs/Stepper) for some already done examples.
- An example component to hold component state might look something like this:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Frame, useCycle } from "framer";

export function Stepper(props) {
  const [number, setNumber] = React.useState(0);

  return <Frame onClick={setNumber}>{number}</Frame>;
}
```

### Stretch Goals

After meeting the minimum requirements for the Stepper component, you might have some extra time to add some extra functionality.

Here are some stretch goals:

- Add [`propertyControl`](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls) to set a min and a max for the Stepper.
